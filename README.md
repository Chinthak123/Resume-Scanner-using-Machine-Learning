# Resume-Scanner-using-Machine-Learning
Project Overview

This project is a Resume Scanner built using Python and machine learning techniques. The main aim is to analyze resumes and extract meaningful information to understand how well a resume matches a particular job role or requirement. It automates the initial resume screening process and reduces manual effort.

🎯 Objective

To scan and analyze resume content

To preprocess and extract important text features

To apply machine learning techniques for resume classification or matching

To improve efficiency in resume shortlisting

🧠 Approach

Text data is extracted from resumes

Data is cleaned and preprocessed using NLP techniques

Features are generated using vectorization methods

A machine learning model is trained to analyze or classify resumes
